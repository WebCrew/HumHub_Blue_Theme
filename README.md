# humhub_blue_theme
A Blue Theme for HumHub Version  1.9+

Edited and updated by **WebCrew** / Andreas Holzer - [crazymates.de](https://crazymates.de)

This theme was created with changes to the theme.css file only. This has the small advantage that this theme will continue to work even after HumHub updates (i.e. it does not degenerate into another GitHib / HumHub project corpse, as usual). 

However, I have not adapted every single module CSS file to the blue style - that remains the task of the module developer or that of the site operator. I will possibly update this theme after HH updates if this is necessary. Otherwise, it remains the responsibility of the HH site operator to keep his theme in good condition. 

I am making this theme available to everyone for free. If you want to thank me, please give me a "STAR" or DONATE a little something - a link to a donation form can be found below in the readme. However, I don't assume that very few people want to donate because, as advertising teaches us, "Avarice is cool" (not my opinion)

Kind rergards, Andy (WebCrew)
